## My own statement 
An email randomizer created to bring awareness to social engineering attacks via email. Although everything is virutal online, cybersecurity must always be taken seriously and can bring harm or put one's own privacy at their own expense. 

As more people grow reliant on online communication, it's important that we educate ourselves and learn how to fend off these kinds of attacks by taking preventative measures, whether it be education, using our own intuition, or just being aware of the most common issues and attacks. 

The internet is an irreplacable tool, and we should all do our best to stop these kinds of scams and educate others on it.
